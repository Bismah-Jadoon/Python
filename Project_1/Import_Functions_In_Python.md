### What is `import` in Python?
The `import` statement in Python is used to bring in external modules or libraries into your script, allowing you to use their built-in functions and features.

In your Snake, Water, Gun game, you use:
```python
import random
```
This imports Pythonâ€™s built-in `random` module, which allows you to generate random choices using `random.choice()`.

### Are the functions used built-in or user-defined?
- **Built-in functions**: These are provided by Python and available for use without defining them. In your code, the built-in functions used include:
  - `input()`: Gets user input.
  - `print()`: Displays output.
  - `random.choice()`: Selects a random item from a list.

- **User-defined functions**: These are functions that you create yourself to perform specific tasks. In your code:
  - `computer()`: A function you defined to let the computer make a random choice.
  - `Human()`: A function you defined to take user input.
