#  learning about input function

# a = input("Enter number 1 : ") # taking value from user using input function
# b = input("Enter number 2 : ") 

# print("The value of number 1  is : ", a)
# print("The value of number 2  is : ", b)

# print("The sum of two numbers is : ", a + b) # it will concatenate both numbers not give sum because the input we are taking from user is string so the interpreter give us the concatenation of two strings 




# solution of the above problem 
a = int(input("Enter number 1 : ")) # convert it to integer
b = int(input("Enter number 2 : ") )

print("The value of number 1  is : ", a)
print("The value of number 2  is : ", b)

print("The sum of two numbers is : ", a + b) #now it will give the sum
